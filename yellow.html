		  <p class="card-text">Yellow Submarine is the tenth studio album by English rock band the Beatles, released on 13 January 1969 
			  in the United States and on 17 January 1969 in the United Kingdom. It was issued as the soundtrack to the animated film of 
			  the same name, which premiered in London in July 1968. The album contains six songs by the Beatles, including four new songs 
			  and the previously released "Yellow Submarine" and "All You Need Is Love". The remainder of the album is a re-recording of 
			  the film's orchestral soundtrack by the band's producer, George Martin.<br>The project was regarded as a contractual obligation 
			  by the Beatles, who were asked to supply four new songs for the film. Some songs were written and recorded specifically for 
			  the soundtrack, while others were unreleased tracks from other projects. The album was recorded before – and issued two 
			  months after – the band's self-titled double LP (also known as the "White Album") and was not viewed by the band as a 
			  significant release. An EP containing only the new songs had been considered for release, and was mastered, but left 
			  unreleased. The original mono mixes were later included in the 2009 compilation Mono Masters.</p>
